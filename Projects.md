# Final Project - Geo 305: Elements of Cartography - Fall 2022

The purpose of this class was to practice making maps that are more appealing to the eyes. We focused less on the data driven maps and more thematic and artistic maps. Since I am from Virginia I chose to make a map of the Shenandoah National Park and the trails inside it. I used QGIS along with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
